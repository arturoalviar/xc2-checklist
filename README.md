# Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Checklist

[See live site](https://arturoalviar.github.io/xc2-checklist/#/)

I needed a way to keep track of what blades I collected in game so I decided to build this simple app.

The app uses localstorage to cache the collected blades along with some user settings.

## Running the build

To run a local build, first do:

```
$ yarn
```

Start dev build:

```
$ npm start
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
